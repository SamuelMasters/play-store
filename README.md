### About

This project, "play-store", is an eCommerce web application where users can browse video game and board game products, add them to a basket, and purchase them via Stripe payments. Users are also able to sign up to a "dummy" newsletter, and can submit contact queries. Site owners / admin have full CRUD functionality with the products listed on the site, and can add, edit, and delete products from the front-end. 

---

## Business Model

Play-Store is a B2C business (business to customer) eCommerce site specialising in the sale of video games and board games, intended for educational purposes only. It includes a mockup Facebook page, which in a real business scenario, would serve to help build brand awareness and reach, as well as SEO practises to help improve the site's visiblity on search engines such as Google. 

### Marketing Strategy
Play-Store utilises two main features as part of it's marketing strategy; a Facebook business page, and a newsletter.

##### Facebook Business Page
The Facebook business page offers an avenue for the business to more directly interact with customers on an individual basis. By having a Facebook business page, the business can provide updates to customers that might be considered 'spammy' or unnecessary if they were communicated via a newsletter or other direct email. In other words, the page allows the business a way to communicate with customers without requiring a specific reason. That said, the page can be used in that manner if required, for example if a customer comments on a post stating they had an issue or query, they can be redirected to a private message for individual customer service or their query can be answered publicly with another comment, which then demonstrates good customer service to everyone who views the page; they can see that the business engages with it's customers. 

Apart from customer engagement, the page improves the site's visiblity as it can be visible to a very large audience of social media users, and it takes advantage of social media networking algorithms as well. For example, if a customer has liked the business' page, then that like can be shown to the user's friends, who in turn might share that interest and explore the page for themselves.

</details>

##### Newsletter
The newsletter allows the business to easily send mass communication out to customers who are more likely to take advantage of provided discounts and other promotions. Since the newsletter requires the user to opt-in, it means that those who have opted-in have specifically made the decision to allow contact between themselves and the business, which a one-time customer or browsing user is unlikely to do. The newsletter also offers a way for the business to quickly and easily send out mass communication to this section of it's customer base. One example of how the newsletter might be incentivised is by offering exclusive discount codes to subscribers, which could help build the number of newsletter subscribers as well as improve conversion rates and sales as a whole.

### Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)
The site makes use of meta tags to increase searchability, by including keywords relevant to the site's content and intended audience such as 'video games', 'games', 'store', 'gaming', and more. 

It also includes the 'robots.txt' and 'sitemap.xml' files. The sitemap file is useful for SEO because it helps search engines crawl every important page on your site, and the robots.txt file tells search engines where they're not allowed to go - having this file present within the web application is viewed as a sign of quality by search engines, which in turn improves the site's SEO too.

## User Stories

User stories were created at project start and were arranged planned out using Lucidchart. They were then copied over into Github Issues and setup on a project board with MoSCoW prioritisation labels applied.

## Design

### Colours

The colour scheme uses light, mild colouring to help provide contrast against the dark text used on the site. 

### Fonts

Google Fonts was used to provide the font for the website. [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow?preview.text=Your%20one%20stop%20shop%20for%20the%20best%20deals.&preview.text_type=custom) was chosen for it's simplicity and clean lines.

### Structure

#### Website Pages

The website uses different templates / pages to comprise it's structure.

The top of each page features a simple navbar showing the site's "Play.com" logo (which also acts as a home button), along with dynamic authentication links which change depending on whether or not the user is logged in. Also included are links to a profile page, which shows an authenticated user their saved delivery information (if they have any) as well as a basic order history which they can interact with to view past order confirmations. Finally, a bag icon is included which dynamically changes to show the current total value of items a user has in their bag, and clicking this icon leads a user towards checkout. 

The bottom of each page features a simple footer with multiple links. 
- "Contact Us" takes the user to a page where they can fill in a form to send a general query to the site admin. 
- "Privacy Policy" takes the user to a page where the application's privacy policy is detailed in full.
- "Newsletter" takes the user to a page where they can enter their email address to signup to a newsletter (an real email is sent upon submitting here).
- "Facebook" is a dummy social media link which opens Facebook's home page in another tab, but in a real eCommerce application, this would point to the site's business page.

- The website consists of the following sections:
  - Products
  - Product Detail
  - Bag
  - Checkout
  - Authentication (Sign In, Signup, Sign Out)

#### Database

Data for this project is stored is an ElephantSQL postgres database. Data models were planned in advance using Lucidchart. Final implementation of the application's models differ from the initial plans shown here, however the process of planning which models might be required and how they might be comprised was helpful in the initial setup stages.

## Validation

The [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) was used to validate the HTML files used in this project.
<details><summary>Home</summary>
<img src="docs/validators/home-validation.jpg">
</details>

<details><summary>Products</summary>
<img src="docs/validators/products-validation.jpg">

<img src="docs/validators/checkout-success-validation.jpg">
</details>

<details><summary>User Profile</summary>
<img src="docs/validators/user-profile-validation.jpg">
</details>
There was an unresolved issue whilst validating the user profile page. It is believed to be caused by an authentication issue, as only authenticated users can render this page, and the validator had no way of passing as an authenticated user.

<details><summary>Add Product</summary>

</details>

<details><summary>Privacy Policy</summary>
<img src="docs/validators/privacy-validation.jpg">
</details>

### CSS Validation
The [Jigsaw CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the CSS files in the project. CSS had to be validated via direct input, as attempting to validate via URL caused parsing errors due to the included Bootstrap style sheets

</details>

<details><summary>Direct input validation result</summary>
<img src="docs/validators/css-validation.jpg">
</details>

### JavaScript Validation
[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the JS files in the project.

<details><summary>script.js</summary>
<img src="docs/validators/js-toast-validation.jpg">
</details>
The validator shows an unused variable here, however this script was largely adapated from the toast script used in the Boutique Ado project as it was fit-for-purpose for this project. Therefore the file was unchanged in this project's implementation of toasts. 

<details><summary>stripe_elements.js</summary>
<img src="docs/validators/js-stripe-validation.jpg">
</details>

### PEP8 Validation
[Code Institute's Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used to validate the Python files in the project.

## Testing

Automated testing was not used for this project. Features were tested manually by proceeding through the customer journey and debugging errors or other unintended behaviours as they occurred throughout that journey.

## Bugs

1. UNRESOLVED - Image sizes could not be kept consistent across the project, this was particularly noticeable on the project detail pages where some images take up huge amounts of space compared to others. It was not fixed before submission as it was deemed as less important than other fixes. 
2. UNRESOLVED - Validation emails sent to users who signed up for a newsletter contained links which, when clicked, were meant to affect their instance of the Subscriber model by confirming their "confirmation key". However this does not work yet as there were issues with attaching the confirmation key to the Subscriber instance newly created when the user submits the form. 
3. RESOLVED - When toasts were first implemented they did not dismiss, and were 'stuck' on the screen. After some research, a fellow student had encountered a similar issue and provided a block of JavaScript which fixed the issue. Richard Ash is incldued in the credits below for this fix. 
4. RESOLVED - At one point a redirect loop was identified when authorised non-superusers attempted to access restricted URLs which were protected with a decorator which tested for superuser permissions. When this happened the page would crash and and browser error message indicating a redirect loop was reported. To resolve this, additional decorators were added to the views that returned these pages in a 'stacking' method. The new decorator first checks for general authentication and specifically redirects anonymous users to the login page, and the original decorator then also checks that the user is a superuser, and redirects them to the site's error page if they are not.

## Credits

- Some parts of this project includes code originally shown in Chris Zielinski's ['Boutique Ado'](https://github.com/ckz8780/boutique_ado_v1/tree/50af34fe6cacbb53181e58860f2dc21fd313950e) walkthrough project. Where relevant, changes have been made to the original code to fit the purposes of this project. However in some cases, no changes have been required in the code to achieve the required functionality. These blocks have been commented against to indicate that they have been carried across and adapated for use in this project. 
- [Devsheet.com](https://devsheet.com/code-snippet/allow-or-limit-a-view-to-superuser-only-django/) helped me understand how to limit a view to a superuser only.
- [Richard Ash's solution](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C7HS3U3AP/p1633769555244600?thread_ts=1633696310.225500&cid=C7HS3U3AP) resolved an issue I was having with toasts in this project.
- [Ordinary Coders](https://ordinarycoders.com/blog/article/build-a-django-contact-form-with-email-backend) provided a useful tutorial which helped me to create a contact form. 
- [Twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com/blog/build-email-newsletter-django-twilio-sendgrid) helped provide information on how one might approach implementing an email newsletter.

## Design

### Colours

The colour scheme uses light, mild colouring to help provide contrast against the dark text used on the site. 

### Fonts

Google Fonts was used to provide the font for the website. [Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow?preview.text=Your%20one%20stop%20shop%20for%20the%20best%20deals.&preview.text_type=custom) was chosen for it's simplicity and clean lines.

### Structure

#### Website Pages

The website uses different templates / pages to comprise it's structure.

The top of each page features a simple navbar showing the site's "Play.com" logo (which also acts as a home button), along with dynamic authentication links which change depending on whether or not the user is logged in. Also included are links to a profile page, which shows an authenticated user their saved delivery information (if they have any) as well as a basic order history which they can interact with to view past order confirmations. Finally, a bag icon is included which dynamically changes to show the current total value of items a user has in their bag, and clicking this icon leads a user towards checkout. 

The bottom of each page features a simple footer with multiple links. 
- "Contact Us" takes the user to a page where they can fill in a form to send a general query to the site admin. 
- "Privacy Policy" takes the user to a page where the application's privacy policy is detailed in full.
- "Newsletter" takes the user to a page where they can enter their email address to signup to a newsletter (an real email is sent upon submitting here).
- "Facebook" is a dummy social media link which opens Facebook's home page in another tab, but in a real eCommerce application, this would point to the site's business page.

- The website consists of the following sections:
  - Products
  - Product Detail
  - Bag
  - Checkout
  - Authentication (Sign In, Signup, Sign Out)

#### Database

Data for this project is stored is an ElephantSQL postgres database. Data models were planned in advance using Lucidchart. Final implementation of the application's models differ from the initial plans shown here, however the process of planning which models might be required and how they might be comprised was helpful in the initial setup stages.

2. Create a new app, choose a unique app name for your app, and select your region.
3. Click "Create app".

5. Install the plugins dj-database-url and psycopg2-binary from the CLI in your workspace.
6. Install django and gunicorn from the CLI in your workspace.
7. Use the terminal command "pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt" to generate your requirements.txt file, required for Heroku deployment.
8. Create a Procfile in your app and enter the following, replacing PROJECT_NAME with your app name: 
   (web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi)
9.  Ensure that your settings.py file is connected to your new Postgres database from Heroku.
10. In settings.py, check that Debug = False.
